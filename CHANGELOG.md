# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First release.

- `judge`, `scan` and `report` over TypeSafe's Jev (`/v1/systemone`).
- Before any text leaves the machine, comments are blanked (line numbers kept) and secrets
  redacted. Code and comments are asked in separate calls.
- Catalogue `general.v3`:
  - 16 general fault statements
  - 4 per language for Go, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript and Java
  - 5 about comments
- Scoring: findings at p ≥ 0.6; low / medium / high deduct 5 / 12 / 25 from their dimension; the
  index is the mean of the dimensions present; bands are clean, minor, moderate and severe.
- Answers are cached by content, catalogue and model, so an unchanged tree re-scans without a
  call.
- The scan is resumable, six Jev calls per step. It follows the language table, `.gitignore`,
  `.gitattributes` and the caller's excludes. It skips nested repositories, symlinks,
  secret-named, binary, generated, minified, oversize and test files, and counts every skip by
  reason.
- A text Jev's hosted edge refuses is recorded under `refused`, and the scan moves on.
